# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify factors that contribute to cancellations and develop strategies to mitigate them, ultimately reducing the cancellation rate and improving hotel revenue.
## Objectives:

* Identify key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations:

* Analyze various factors such as lead time, arrival date, market segment, country of origin, deposit type, customer demographics, and booking channels.
* Determine the relative importance of each factor in predicting cancellation likelihood.
* Quantify the impact of price on cancellation rates:

* Investigate the correlation between average daily rate (ADR) and cancellation rates across different hotel types and seasons.
* Determine the price sensitivity of different customer segments.
* Understand seasonal patterns in cancellations:

* Analyze monthly and seasonal trends in cancellation rates to identify periods with higher cancellation risks.
* Explore the reasons behind these seasonal variations.
* Explore the role of market segments and booking channels:

* Compare cancellation rates across different market segments (e.g., online travel agents, groups, corporate) and booking channels (e.g., direct, online, offline).
* Identify segments and channels with higher cancellation tendencies.
* Develop actionable recommendations to reduce cancellations:

* Based on the insights gained from the analysis, propose strategies to mitigate cancellation risks.
* These strategies could include adjusting pricing strategies, implementing targeted promotions, improving booking flexibility, enhancing customer communication, and 
  optimizing booking processes.
* Evaluate the potential impact of these recommendations:

* Estimate the potential reduction in cancellation rates and the associated increase in revenue if the recommendations are implemented.
* Provide a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed strategies.
