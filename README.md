# Hotel-Booking-Analysis (Python)
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify factors that contribute to cancellations and develop strategies to mitigate them, ultimately reducing the cancellation rate and improving hotel revenue.
## Objectives:

* Identify key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations:

* Analyze various factors such as lead time, arrival date, market segment, country of origin, deposit type, customer demographics, and booking channels.
* Determine the relative importance of each factor in predicting cancellation likelihood.
* Quantify the impact of price on cancellation rates:

* Investigate the correlation between average daily rate (ADR) and cancellation rates across different hotel types and seasons.
* Determine the price sensitivity of different customer segments.
* Understand seasonal patterns in cancellations:

* Analyze monthly and seasonal trends in cancellation rates to identify periods with higher cancellation risks.
* Explore the reasons behind these seasonal variations.
* Explore the role of market segments and booking channels:

* Compare cancellation rates across different market segments (e.g., online travel agents, groups, corporate) and booking channels (e.g., direct, online, offline).
* Identify segments and channels with higher cancellation tendencies.
* Develop actionable recommendations to reduce cancellations:

* Based on the insights gained from the analysis, propose strategies to mitigate cancellation risks.
* These strategies could include adjusting pricing strategies, implementing targeted promotions, improving booking flexibility, enhancing customer communication, and 
  optimizing booking processes.
* Evaluate the potential impact of these recommendations:

* Estimate the potential reduction in cancellation rates and the associated increase in revenue if the recommendations are implemented.
* Provide a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed strategies.

##  Project Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration

* Import necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, and warnings.
* Load the dataset: Reads the 'hotel_bookings.csv' file into a pandas DataFrame called df.
* Data Overview: Examines the first few rows, shape, columns, and data types using head(), shape, columns, and info().
* Convert data types: Converts the 'reservation_status_date' column to datetime format.
* Descriptive Statistics: Uses describe() to understand the numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.
#### Step 2: Data Cleaning

* Handling Missing Values: Identifies and removes columns ('company', 'agent') and rows with missing values to ensure data quality.
* Outlier Detection and Removal: Uses box plots to detect outliers in the 'adr' (average daily rate) column and removes them to prevent skewed analysis.
#### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

* Cancellation Rate: Calculates and visualizes the overall cancellation rate using bar charts.
* Cancellation by Hotel Type: Compares cancellation rates between city and resort hotels using count plots.
* Average Daily Rate Trends: Analyzes trends in average daily rates for both hotel types over time using line plots.
* Cancellation by Month: Examines cancellation patterns across different months using count plots.
* Cancellation and Price: Investigates the relationship between cancellation and average daily rate using bar plots.
* Cancellation by Country: Identifies the top countries with the highest cancellation rates using pie charts.
* Market Segment Analysis: Explores the distribution of bookings across different market segments and their impact on cancellation rates.
* Average Daily Rate and Cancellation: Further analyzes the relationship between average daily rate and cancellation using line plots, focusing on specific time periods.
#### Step 4: Conclusion and Insights

* Key Findings: Summarizes the main findings from the analysis, highlighting factors like price, seasonality, and market segments that influence cancellation rates.
* Recommendations: Proposes strategies to reduce cancellations, such as adjusting pricing strategies, implementing targeted marketing campaigns, and improving service 
  quality.
